# Control - A General Guide

The Control Team is a crucial part of the competition. We have seen many teams with fascinating mechanical & electrical design, but failed to design a feasible control system that limited their performance on the field. The robot may even kill itself if its shooting speed went above the limit or chassis power went too high. Therefore, the control team aims to design a control system that not only allows the general movement & shooting of the robot, but also optimize the robot performance through smoother and more responsive human-robot interaction, and automatic mode switching based on the feedback from the referee system. \\
Members will learn STM32 as the embedded system, communication protocols, feedback control, and many related knowledge on the way as they proceed to the design & optimization of the competition robot control system.
