# Control Team

In control team, we eliminate the gap between human and a robot. By collecting sensors data coming from other teams and making decision internally, operator’s command could be understood and realized by a machine as if it’s alive robot. By applying control theory, such as PID design based on model dynamics, one is able to regulate system even if it has inherent complexity. Three main topics are going on in control team: drive system dynamics analysis followed by velocity and position control, gimbal stability control and improvement, and prediction on projectile trajectory. Based off these topics, our undergraduate students are developing innovative solutions to make the robot stronger. For example, one of the teammates was able to design a dodge mode for the robot drive system such that it could avoid most of damage during the completion. More and interesting topics are welcome and we certainly need your input and ideas.
