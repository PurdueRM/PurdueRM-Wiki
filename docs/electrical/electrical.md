# Electrical Team

Our electrical team is the backbone of the robot which connects the computer vision team hardware, the control team hardware together and provides stable power at the same time. The electrical team also design and implement the sensor on the robot which can provide insight to the player for things like the distance to the wall, and it can also automate some complicated process such as climbing the stair and pick up the ammo box. One of the highlights of the electrical team project is the super-capacitor booster which enables a robot to accelerate much faster during a time of need, around 5-6x faster. The electrical team member implements and design most of the embedded system on board, they also custom design PCB for all the sub-system.
