**How does the algorithm team operate?**

- We operate on a weekly basis, with a team meeting once a week. At each team meeting, we will check-in on every active issue, to ensure progress is being made. Any due/overdue issues will be the primary focus.
- We follow a procedure for contributing code, which involves being assigned to an Issue in GitLab, making your changes, writing test cases, and getting your code reviewed + pushed to master
