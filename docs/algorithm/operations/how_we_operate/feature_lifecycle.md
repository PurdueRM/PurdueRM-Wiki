# How to Contribute Code

**Feature lifecycle**: If a member wishes to work on an issue on GitLab, they must follow this process:
    
   - Pick one person to be the CAPTAIN of this issue, and assign the issue to them. Anyone else working on this issue should be pinged in the description. Do the same for each sub-task in the issue.
   - Still on the issue page, create a branch and merge request with the button in the top right. Make sure to mark it as a draft (it probably is by default) to not cause confusion.
   - You may begin coding! Upon completing your issue, unmark the “draft” checkbox in your merge request. Start a code review by assigning a code reviewer in the right panel.
   - The code reviewer will suggest improvements to your code, then will follow through with the merge. If you receive feedback, you should make the needed changes and notify the reviewer when you’re done.


    
**What if I want to propose a new issue?:**
   
   - Create a new issue under the correct project. Add a good description and select an appropriate label. *Add  sub-tasks for each smaller deliverable if this is a larger project!*
   - Ping a code reviewer / team lead and discuss the issue with them. Work out a timeframe and deliverables.
   - A member is eventually assigned to the issue, and they are to begin the Feature Lifecycle process.
   


    
   **Code Evaluations**
   
   - During each code evaluation, a team lead will:
       - Review and verify test cases (do they cover core functionality and edge cases?)
       - Static code analysis (conventions, clean code)
   - *For smaller changes, this process is done almost asynchronously (Discord at worst). For larger changes, meeting with a team lead to demonstrate functionality is strictly required.*
