## This page will serve to briefly summarize the goals and instructions for the SWE and ROS2 project.


**Objective**: Create a ROS2 node that subscribes to the topic "talker" and prints out the message received

**Goals**:
- Get introduced to ROS2
- Understand how to create and communicate between nodes in our codebase
  - General node structure
  - CMakeLists
  - package.xml
- Understand best practices in software engineering


**Instructions:**
1. Log onto the development server
2. `cd` into `onboarding_files/ros2`.
3. You have **three* files you need to complete. Don't worry, two are literally just filling in a couple words.

**Resources and helpful info:**
If you don't understand a step, look it up! No shame in consulting documentation.
