## This page will serve to briefly summarize the goals and instructions for the ML onboarding project.

**Objective**: Create an image classifier following this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification

**Goals**:
- Get introduced to basic machine learning 
- Understand how image classifiers are created
- Introduced to terms such as overfitting, accuracy, loss...

**Instructions:**
1. Log onto the development server and `cd` into `onboarding_files/ml`.
2. There will be a file called `instructions.txt`. It will provide very brief instructions on what this project entails
3. Open the tutorial. You should now create a new `.py` file and get started!
4. Specific expectations and deliverables are in the instructions.txt file.
 
**Resources and helpful info:**
If you don't understand a step, look it up! No shame in consulting documentation. The tutorial should be entirely comprehensive though.
