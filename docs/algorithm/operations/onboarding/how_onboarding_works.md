### Overview:
This season, we have designed two project options for members to choose from. You must select and complete one of the following projects before the second meeting:
1. **Computer Vision**: Detect the Earth in the famous Pale Blue Dot image
2. **SWE / ROS2**: Explore our code pipeline and write software to receive a message published by our robot
3. **ML**: Createa number classifier model (very difficult).

You should have already filled out the Google Form to join the team (if not, DM `@tomdonel`). Within 48 hours of filling out the form, you will receive an email with your login information to the development server.

***

### **To log onto the server**, follow these instructions:
If you are on MacOS or Ubuntu:
- For MacOS, install XQuartz: https://www.xquartz.org/.
- Open a terminal window and type: `ssh -XC your_puid@tx2.purduerm.org -p 10051`. 
- Enter your password (from email) and you will be placed into your home directory. If you are asked to accept/deny a key, accept it. 
- Your starter code for onboarding is waiting for you!

If you are on Windows:
- Install X410 server from https://www.x410.dev (free version).
- Install PuTTY from https://www.putty.org.
- Open PuTTY. Under the "Connection" > "SSH" > "X11" settings, make sure the `Enable X11 forwarding` option is checked. Set `localhost:0.0` as the "X display location".
For your login information:
	- Hostname: `tx2.purduerm.org`
	- Port: `10051`
- In the save/load box **save this profile with a name**. Every time you want to log in, you will load this profile.
- Hit connect, and for Username/Password see your email. You will be placed into your home directory! If you are asked to accept/deny a key, accept it.
- Your starter code for onboarding is waiting for you!
