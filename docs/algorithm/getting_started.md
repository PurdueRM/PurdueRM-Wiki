# Getting Started   

The algorithm team are incharged of two parts: the auto aim system and the sentry AI. 

### Auto Aim System
The Auto aim system aims to detect, model, predict enemy armor plate and communicate this information to the control board.

# Tools
## C++
C++ is the most commonly used language for the algo team. C++ is an Object-Oriented langue widely used due to it's fast execution time and ease of use. We uses C++ because of those properties, but also various packages available in C++ (ie. ROS, TensorRT, CUDA Kernel). 
A strong foundation in C++ is highly recommended as most of our impletion work will be in C++. Luckily, resources for learning C++ is widely available. To list some example:
- [learningcpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)  
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus)

## Python

## Ubuntu (Linux) 

## Git

## CMake
CMake is a tool for program compilation and linking. Most of our project utilized multitude of libraries and CMake can to simplify the compile and linking process greatly. It is also an requirement for ROS packages.
