# Navigating the GitLab Repository
### By Tom O'Donnell (tkodonne@purdue.edu)

 Using the GitLab is one of the first main tasks you should get familiar with. To see documentation of individual portions of the code, see the repo, it's already documented.

We have a TX2 server set up to do work on, which is also the platform we will run all of our software on.

You should already have sent your public SSH key to your team lead (generated by `ssh-keygen`). Also, 
you should understand how to SSH into the server (`ssh name@address.org --port xxx`). I will not provide the address or port for security reasons.

From here, feel free to make your own folder in the home directory, and clone the GitLab repo using `git clone <git url>`. Make sure to get all required submodules using `git submodule update --init` and `git submodule update --init --remote`.

# Compiling

`cmake .`  to generate a makefile
``make -j `nproc` `` to build the repo using all available processing units (please don't use all cores while others are using the server).

For more specific compiling options and flags, see the table on [https://gitlab.com/robomaster-club/armor-detection](https://gitlab.com/robomaster-club/armor-detection).

# Further Info
Get familiar with using `git`, including cloning, pushing, and definitely switching branches using the `checkout` command.
