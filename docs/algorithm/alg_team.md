Tasked with updating and computer vision and machine learning routines for enemy robot detection and decision making.
### Tools we use
- YOLO   
	- An object-detection algorithm used to detect enemy robots.   
- OpenCV
    - A C++ and Python Library designed for computer vision. 
- TensorRT
    - C++ library for neural network inference acceleration on CUDA cores. 
- UART 
    - Serial port communication with referee system and control board. 
- ROS
    - Robot Operating System, a asynchronous modular platform for robot applications.
