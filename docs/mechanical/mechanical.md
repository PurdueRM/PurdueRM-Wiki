# Mechanical Team

<!-- The mechanical team is the backbone of our club. With over 30 members, mechanical team design, prototype and manufacture all robots. Using Solidworks, members design all mechanical parts and combine electrical parts into digital assembly that provide a platform for all other teams to perform their magic. Our ultimate goal is for members to design for manufacturing. As we utilize different manufacturing methods including 3D printing, CNC milling, Water-jet cutting, members not only gain knowledge on how to operate the machines outside of classroom, but also improve their ability to designing CAD and prepare themselves to become better engineers.

Members will also learn to design an efficient manufacturing process and perform basic failure mode analysis to prevent potential hazards and malfunctions. -->
