# Design Library
Here we present parameters of certain standard components, including screws, nuts, standardoff, retaining rings and bearings. 

# Screws
We are mainly using M2.5, M3 and M4 screws in our robots.

## Socket Hex Screws

## Shoulder Screws
These types of screws consist of integral threads that are present on half or less of the screw shank and the rest of the shaft is enlarged and smooth to allow the bolted material the ability to rotate or move around the screw axis.
Much like all other screws, shoulder screws are meant to hold objects together and in a particular position. However, these screws are designed for use in parts which requires a mounting pin, joint, shaft, dowel, pivot, or sliding motion. 
Items such as:

 - Bearings
 - Bushings
 - Machinery support
 - Motion guiding
 - Precision spacing
