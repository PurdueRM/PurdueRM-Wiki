<p><strong>Here I will answer the questions of:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What qualifies as a “good” dataset?</li>
  <li>How can I increase the reliability of YoloV5?</li>
</ul>

<p>A “good” dataset is one that enables a balance between accuracy with size. With YoloV5, good results can be obtained with minimal tweaking, assuming your dataset is labelled well, and has an adequate size.</p>

<p>The size of your dataset will obviously vary based on your needs, however Yolov5 recommends &gt;1.5k images, and &gt;10k labelled objects total.</p>

<h2 id="increasing-yolov5-accuracy">Increasing YoloV5 accuracy</h2>
<p><strong>Dataset conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect data under varying conditions (lighting, angles, environments). Your goal is to accurately represent your deployment environment.</li>
  <li>ADD AUGMENTATIONS TO IMAGES, such as rotating, cutting out specific portions, distortions, etc. (it’s free dataset diversification)</li>
  <li>Add 0-10% “background images” with no objects to reduce false positives</li>
  <li>Larger Yolo models such as YOLOv5x will likely produce better results, but at the cost of performance and longer training time.</li>
  <li>Start with <em>pretrained weights</em> for small/medium datasets. Larger datasets should use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--weights ''</code> flag to start new.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Training Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Adjust epochs if overfitting/underfitting occurs</li>
  <li>Usually you’ll want to train at the same image size that your images are.</li>
  <li>Use the largest batch size your hardware supports.</li>
</ul>
